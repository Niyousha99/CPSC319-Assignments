# Assignment 3

## Build instructions

```bash
make
```

It should compile all the java source files that need to be re-built. The build has been tested with GNU compiler Linux (Fedora 26).

## Usage

From the Command Prompt, type "javac" with the class names of the program. My main class is "Main" and should be executed, after compiling with
"Makefile," with no arguments.

If Main.java , FileManager.java , and BST.java produce Main.class , FileManager.class , and BST.class after compliation, then type as below:

```bash
java Main FileManager BST
```

If all goes well, the output of the program should be displayed/generated.
Please note that input text files must be in the same directory as the program.
