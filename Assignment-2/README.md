# Assignment 2

This Java program arranges a list of words into separate lists of anagrams.

## Build instructions

```bash
make
```

It should compile all the java source files that need to be re-built. The build has been tested with GNU compiler Linux (Fedora 26).

## Usage

From the Command Prompt, type "java" with the class names of the program. My main class is "CPSC319W20A2" and should be executed with another class "AnagramList", after compiling with
"Makefile," with either user typed arguments of words separated by spaces, or text files.

If CPSC319W20A2.java and AnagramList.java both produce CPSC319W20A2.class and AnagramList.class after compliation, then type as below:

```bash
java CPSC319W20A2 AnagramList
```

If all goes well, the output of the program should be displayed/generated.
