# Assignment 4

The goal of this assignment is to use data from a project in image processing to create and explore data using a graph structure. The storage structure being used is an adjacency matrix. From this graph, a minimum spanning tree (MST) is then created.

## Build instructions

```bash
make
```

It should compile all the java source files that need to be re-built. The build has been tested with GNU compiler Linux (Fedora 26).

## Usage

From the Command Prompt, type "javac" with the class name of the program. My main class is "CPSC319W20A4.java" and should be executed, after compiling with
"Makefile," with one filename argument.

If CPSC319W20A4.java produces CPSC319W20A4.class after compliation, then type as below:

```bash
java CPSC319W20A4 < text file name
```

If all goes well, the output text files of the program should be generated within the same directory.
Please note that input text files must be in the same directory as the program.
Please note that larger input text files will require more time for the propgram to finish writing into the output text files.
