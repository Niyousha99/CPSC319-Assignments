# Assignment 1

## Build instructions

```bash
make
```

It should compile all the java source files that need to be re-built. The build has been tested with GNU compiler Linux (Fedora 26).

## Usage

From the Command Prompt, type "java" with the class name of the program. My main class is "Fib" and should be executed, after compiling with
"Makefile," with no arguments.

If Fib.java produces Fib.class after compliation, then type as below:

```bash
java Fib
```

If all goes well, the output of the program should be displayed/generated.
